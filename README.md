## Introduction
The project on Fatal Dog Attacks in the USA between the year 2020 and 2022 aims to analyze and visualize data related to dog attacks resulting in human fatalities. The purpose of this project is to provide insights into the circumstances and characteristics of fatal dog attacks, as well as to identify potential risk factors and patterns. The data includes information on the location, date, victim demographics, dog breed, and other relevant factors. 

## Problem statement
About 30 to 50 individuals in the US per year pass away as a result of fatal dog attacks, and the rate of these fatalities seems to be rising. Every year, around 4.5 million Americans are bitten by dogs, which causes 6,000 to 13,000 individuals to be hospitalized in the country.

This dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kabhishm/fatal-dog-attacks-in-the-us-202022 contains information collected on dogs attack in the USA between 2020 and 2022. 
By using Power BI, we will create interactive reports and visualizations that enable us to explore the data in detail and gain a deeper understanding of the issue. This project can be valuable for policymakers, animal control agencies, and the general public in improving dog safety and preventing future incidents.
